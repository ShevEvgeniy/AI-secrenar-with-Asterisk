# Master Plan

## Project Baseline

- Repository root: `C:\Projects\AI-secrenar-with-Asterisk`
- Source-of-truth branch: `master`
- Source-of-truth commit: `df69f3222cec78a5f7afe2ef09b413f7ab5f3d83`
- Source-of-truth commit message: `Use stage-specific prompts and transfer after data collection`
- Workflow model: master-driven coordination with focused node branches for implementation.

## Confirmed Capabilities

- System sounds prepublish works.
- Publish/playback pipeline works.
- Stage-specific prompts are present in `master`.
- Transfer flow through ARI continue is present in `master`.
- Tracing and logging are required to be preserved across all node work.

## Completed Practical Gap

NODE-001 completed and live-validated the real transfer route through the dialplan:

```text
sales_real -> PJSIP/78007074193@thermo-trunk-endpoint -> DTMF ww52144
```

## Execution Model

- `master` remains the source-of-truth branch.
- Architecture, status, planning, and project coordination are maintained in `docs/master/`.
- Implementation work is performed through focused node branches.
- One node equals one task, one branch, and one execution cycle.
- Avoid broad refactors.
- Do not mix multiple concerns in one node.
- Preserve tracing and logging.

## Current Action Plan

1. Treat NODE-001 as complete and merged into `master`.
2. Preserve the validated runtime transfer target:

```text
context=from-internal
extension=sales_real
priority=1
```

3. Preserve the validated dialplan route:

```text
sales_real -> PJSIP/78007074193@thermo-trunk-endpoint -> DTMF ww52144
```

4. Keep the MicroSIP input-device false negative documented for future live smoke testing.
5. Select the next node only after reviewing the remaining practical gaps from the current master state.

## Node Completion Report Format

After each node, return:

1. Exact files changed.
2. Commit hash.
3. Short result.
4. Validation result.
5. Next recommendation.
